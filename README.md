# HACI-Project
During my PhD research, as a Project Manager of the Himalayan Aerosol Cloud Interaction (HACI) research project and Research Scholar at the University of Manchester, I conducted a field experiment at high altitude region of Nepal including setting up a real-time air quality monitoring station which was complemented by a downscaled high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting modelling through a dynamical downscaling approach. The objective of the research was to collect air pollution data from the Himalayas and projecting its impacts on regional climate using plausible climate change scenarios.
